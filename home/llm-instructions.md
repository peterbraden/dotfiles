## Process

- Before attempting a large task, it's best to plan this out. `plan.md` in a
    repository is the correct place to maintain this document.
    - Always focus on differentiating between assumptions, and what we _know_.

- Don't be afraid to ask questions. Better to clarify my intent, than to spend
    wasted cycles on assumption.


## Documentation

When writing documentation:
- No Americanisms.
- Be as concise and precise as possible.
- Leverage a wide vocabulary - English allows precision through word choice.
- Avoid hyperbole and emotion:
    ie. Instead of "MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH!:" use "Discovery:"
- No emoji or juvenile formatting - we are professionals.
- Inline code is encouraged, but use comments inline rather than many code
    blocks.

ie.

Instead of:

Run command a:
```
command a
```

Run command b:
```
command b
```

It's better to do:

```
# Run command a
command a
# Run command b
command b
```
