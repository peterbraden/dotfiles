# Peter: If you're about to edit these, then this is your guilt trip:
#
# These sites don't make your life better - they make you feel more
# scattered, jittery and damage your attention span. They exploit
# your curiosity and your biological need to know whats going on.
#
# Call a friend, read a book, do some exercise, create. You'll feel
# better for it.
#
# If you really are going to edit these, go take a 20 minute walk
# first. Please.
