# NixOS
I'm not a nix fanboy - I've had enough nix issues to temper any irrational
enthusiasm. Nevertheless I now have several nixos based servers, and use devbox
in some cases.

But nix is a cult, and a lot of the tooling assumes you are locked into the nix
ecosystem for everything - this isn't me - I assume I will be using my dotfiles
on a variety of different distributions / OS's for the foreseeable future. Thus
nix just has to play well with the rest of the team.
